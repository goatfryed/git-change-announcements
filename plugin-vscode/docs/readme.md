The assets in this folder visualise how the VS Code plugin may be implemented.
A new side panel with a plugin icon is added,
displaying which files the user is currently watching and which of these files have changed.
Also, in the editor windows, an alert icon in the top right corner appears, if the current file has been changed.
When entering a changed file, a pop-up window will notify the user to have a look at the changed files.
